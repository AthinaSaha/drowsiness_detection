# drowsiness_detection
Drowsiness detection using opencv (image processing in python).      
The project is based on a computer vision system that can automatically detect the drowsiness of the driver in a real time video-stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.      
My face_predictor_68_landmarks (DAT File) was more than 25 Mb. so it could not be uploaded.
